# Things I learned

For this project? Not much new stuff, but some great practice. This project was most
reminicent of the android app I made all the way back in college.
There's a lot of draw semantics, along with storage consideration.
Stuff like this adds a whole other level of respect for drawing
applications like Krita, Gimp, and Photoshop. Not to mention
game or rendering engines. Edge considerations seem a lot more
pervasive in these sorts of projects, as is mentioned in the
`missing_features.md` section. I also got to practice function composition, which is always a great way to continue honing my general programming skills.
